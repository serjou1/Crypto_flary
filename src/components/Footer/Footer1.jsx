            <br /> Assumption of Risk You assume the risks of engaging in transactions that rely on
            smart contracts and other experimental technology. Transactions on the Flary Finance
            Protocol rely on smart contracts, blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by the
            smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with
            blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently
            risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or
            changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and
            even result in a total loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. You
            are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the
            blockchain address used to interact with the Protocol. We assume no liability or
            responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you
            should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology. One of
            the other defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable,
            which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by
            anyone. This includes smart contracts and cryptoassets generated and programmed by smart
            contracts. THUS, TRANSACTIONS RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF
            CRYPTOASSETS AND DATA PROGRAMMED INTO THESE ASSETS MUST BE TREATED AS PERMANENT AND
            CANNOT BE UNDONE BY US OR BY ANYONE. YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU FINALIZE ANY
            TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. We are not liable for any
            third-party services or links. We are not responsible for the content or services of any
            third-party, including, without limitation, any network, or apps like Discord, or
            MetaMask, and we make no representations regarding the content or accuracy of any
            third-party services or materials. The use and access of any third-party products or
            services, including through the Services, is at your own risk. You agree to the
            automated collection and disbursement of assets by smart contracts. You acknowledge and
            agree that all transactions accessed through the Services will be automatically
            processed using one or more blockchain-based smart contracts. By engaging in
            transactions using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to the automatic processing
            of all transactions in connection with using the Services. You further acknowledge and
            agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate how the funds of a transaction and
            ownership of cryptoassets are distributed. You acknowledge the risks of using the
            Services. You bear sole responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them,
            and all transactions accessed through the Services are irreversible, final, and without
            refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted or adversely impacted as a result of
            sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses, and/or other
            operational or technical challenges, among other things. We disclaim any ongoing
            obligation to notify you of all of the potential risks of using and accessing our
            Services. You acknowledge there is a real risk that assets deposited into the protocol
            and Protocol related tokens: FLFI and vault tokens may suffer complete and permanent
            economic loss should the protocol’s technical or economic mechanisms suffer catastrophic
            failure. You acknowledge that the terms of the Protocol may change at any time for any
            reason included but not limited to protocol fees, rewards, and accessibility. You agree
            to (defined below) accept these risks and agree that you will not seek to hold any Flary
            Indemnified Party responsible for any consequent losses. You are solely responsible for
            the security of your wallet. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible
            for maintaining the security of your wallet. Any unauthorized access to your wallet by
            third parties could result in the loss or theft of any cryptoasset, or any funds held in
            your account and any associated accounts. You understand and agree that we have no
            involvement in, and you will not hold us responsible for managing and maintaining the
            security of your wallet. You further understand and agree that we are not responsible,
            and you will not hold us accountable, for any unauthorized access to your wallet. It is
            your responsibility to monitor your wallet. We reserve the right to restrict your access
            from engaging with the Services. You agree that we have the right to restrict your
            access to the Services via any technically available methods if we suspect, in our sole
            discretion, that (a) you are using the Services for money laundering or any illegal
            activity; (b) you have engaged in fraudulent activity; (c) you have acquired
            cryptoassets using inappropriate methods, including the use of stolen funds to purchase
            such assets; (d) you are the target of any sanctions administered or enforced by the
            U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the United
            Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty’s Treasury, or any other legal
            or regulatory authority in any applicable jurisdiction; (e) either you, as an individual
            or an entity, or your wallet address is listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and
            Blocked Persons List (“SDN List”), Consolidated Sanctions List (“Non-SDN Lists), or any
            other sanctions lists administered by OFAC; (f) you are located, organized, or resident
            in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the subject of sanctions,
            including but not limited to Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Belarus, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North
            Korea, Sudan, and Syria; or (g) you have otherwise acted in violation of these Terms. If
            we have a reasonable suspicion that you are utilizing the Site for illegal purposes, we
            reserve the right to take whatever action we deem appropriate. We do not guarantee the
            quality or accessibility of the Services. As a condition to accessing or using the
            Services or the Site, you acknowledge, understand, and agree that from time to time, the
            Site and the Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, but
            not limited to equipment malfunctions, periodic maintenance procedures or repairs,
            causes beyond our control or that we could not reasonably foresee, disruptions and
            temporary or permanent unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure or
            unavailability of third-party service providers or external partners for any reason. You
            acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services, including, without
            limitation, the Site at your own risk. You should not engage in blockchain-based
            transactions unless it is suitable given your circumstances and financial resources. By
            using the Services, you represent that you have been, are and will be solely responsible
            for conducting your own due diligence into the risks of a transaction and the underlying
            smart contracts and cryptoassets. <br />
            <br /> Taxes You are responsible for your taxes and duties. Users bear sole
            responsibility for paying any and all taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter
            claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with their use of the
            Services, and/or payable as the result of using and/or exploiting any cryptoassets and
            interacting with smart contracts. Blockchain-based transactions are novel, and their tax

            <br />
            <h2>RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE</h2>
            The Token Sale may not result in an active or liquid market for the Tokens.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the event that the Company ever decides to seek the approval for availability of the
            Tokens for trading on any cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that such
            approval will be obtained. Furthermore, even if such approval is granted by a
            cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading market
            for the Tokens will develop, or if developed, will be sustained after the Tokens have
            been made available for trading on such market. There is also no assurance that the
            market price of the Tokens will not decline below the original or issue purchase
            price/Token Private Sale Price (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be
            indicative of the market price of the Tokens after they have been made available for
            trading on a market.
            <br />
            <br />
            A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or
            quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit nor is
            it a commodity in the traditional sense of that word. The Company is not responsible
            for, nor does it pursue, the circulation and trading of Tokens on any market. Trading of
            Tokens will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the relevant market
            participants. No one is obliged to purchase any Token from any holder of the Token,
            including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of
            Tokens to any extent at any time. Furthermore, Tokens may not be resold to purchasers
            who are citizens, nationals, residents (tax or otherwise) and/or green card holders of
            Restricted Jurisdictions or to Restricted Persons or to purchasers in any other
            jurisdiction where the purchase of Tokens may be in violation of applicable laws.
            Accordingly, the Company cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for
            Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of Tokens after
            they have been made available for trading on any cryptocurrency exchange or market.
            <br />
            <br />
            Future sales or issuance of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market
            price of Tokens.
            <br />
            <br />
            Any future sale of the Tokens would increase the supply of Tokens in the market and this
            may result in a downward price pressure on the Token. The sale or distribution of a
            significant number of Tokens outside of the Token Sale (including but not limited to
            transfer of Tokens to persons other than purchasers for purposes of community
            initiatives, business development, academic research, education and market expansion and
            issuance of Tokens as a reward to users of the FlaryFinance that is being further
            developed or otherwise), or the perception that such further sales may occur, could
            adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens.
            <br />
            <br />
            Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Tokens. Negative
            publicity involving the Company, the Company’s that is being further developed, the
            Tokens or any of the key personnel of the Company and/or regulation of distributed
            ledger technologies, cryptocurrencies and/or crowdsales of tokens in any jurisdiction,
            may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Tokens,
            whether or not it is justified.
            <br />
            <br />
            There is no assurance of any success of the Company’s Token Sale or business platform
            that is being further developed as envisaged by the Available Information.
            <br />
            <br /> The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the
            Company’s Token Sale and FlaryFinance that is being further developed and the continuous
            active engagement of its users and success of its contemplated business lines. There is
            no assurance that the Company’s Token Sale will be successful or that the FlaryFinance
            that is being further developed will gain or continue to gain traction. While the
            Company has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also no
            assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Sale will be sufficient for the
            development of the FlaryFinance. For the foregoing or any other reason, the development
            of the FlaryFinance and launch of the anticipated Token functionality may not be
            completed and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. As such,
            distributed Tokens may hold little or no worth or value and this would impact any
            trading price and/or use of the Tokens.
            <br />
            <br /> The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Sale.
            <br />
            <br /> The prices of cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and
            can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The demand for, and the
            corresponding market price of, the Tokens may fluctuate significantly and rapidly in
            response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond the control
            of the Company:
            <br />
            <br /> ‍ - new technical innovations;
            <br /> - analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the
            Token’s market price or the Company’s financial and business performance; <br />-
            changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with businesses similar to
            that of the Company that may be listed on the same cryptocurrency exchanges or markets
            as the Tokens;
            <br /> - announcements by the Company of significant events, for example partnerships,
            sponsorships or new product developments;
            <br /> - fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on
            cryptocurrency exchanges or markets;
            <br /> - additions or departures of key personnel of the Company;
            <br /> - success or failure of the Company’s management in implementing business and
            growth strategies;
            <br /> and/or
            <br /> - changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology
            industry, the general economic conditions or market sentiments, or other events or
            factors.
